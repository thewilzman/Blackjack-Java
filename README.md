# Blackjack-Java
Project of building a blackjack game in Java
Summary
I built a fun blackjack game in java using coding principles like loops and conditionals statements .
What I've learned:
-Scope of variable
-while loops utilization 
-function creation with parameters
-Conditionals statements( if, switch )
-user input scanner
-Randomization with built-in math functions.
How to  Run the app
-Run  it through your preferred IDE
-press enter to start the game 
-enter "hit" to get a new card or stay to keep your hand the same.
